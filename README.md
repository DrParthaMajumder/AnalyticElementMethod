# AnalyticElementMethod
Analytic Element Method (AEM) is a numerical technique for modeling groundwater flow. It uses analytic functions to represent aquifer features, allowing efficient modeling of complex geometries. AEM simplifies computations by using analytical solutions and is widely used in hydrogeology for its flexibility and accuracy.
